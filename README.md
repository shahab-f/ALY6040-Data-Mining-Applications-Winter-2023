### Technique Practice - SVM
### ABSTRACT
This code demonstrates the use of R and the caret package to build a linear SVM model that predicts the presence or absence of heart disease based on specific attributes. The dataset used is from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and the steps involved in the process are loading and preprocessing the data, dividing it into training and testing datasets, training the linear SVM model with cross-validation and parameter tuning, predicting results on the testing data, and analyzing the model's performance using a confusion matrix. The code also includes graphical representations of the trained SVM model and its tuning parameters. This code provides an example of how to use R and caret to develop a linear SVM model and analyze its performance.
