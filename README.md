### Technique Practice - SVM
### ABSTRACT
The report analyzes the diamond dataset by exploring its structure, displaying the distribution of numerical variables, and studying the relationship between variables using a scatterplot matrix. It also examines how categorical variables relate to diamond prices. The report identifies and handles any duplicate records and detects outliers. To address outliers, the report suggests using techniques such as Trimming, Winsorizing, Capping, Imputation, and Robust statistics. Further investigation is necessary to better understand these outliers.

The report highlights the importance of examining subsets of the data to detect potential outliers or anomalies before performing additional analyses or modeling. For example, the scatterplot matrix for the entire dataset is cluttered and difficult to interpret, while the matrix for a randomly selected subset of data is more comprehensible and reveals clearer trends. Outliers can distort statistical analyses and hinder the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

As a next step, the report proposes using regression analysis to study the relationship between price and various variables. Specifically, the report recommends exploring how diamond carat weight affects price and whether this relationship is linear or nonlinear.
