### Technique Practice - SVM
### ABSTRACT
This code presents how to utilize the e1071 package in R for support vector machines (SVM) analysis, which is a robust machine learning approach employed for classification, regression, and density estimation. It involves loading the iris dataset, fitting models using diverse interfaces, assessing model performance, presenting visualizations, developing a regression model, and displaying SVM for density estimation. The code offers a comprehensive overview of SVM usage in R, as well as how to interpret and visualize results.
