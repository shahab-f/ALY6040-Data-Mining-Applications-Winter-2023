### Technique-Practice - Classification Tree
### ABSTRACT
This study aims to create a classification tree model for mushroom classification using R code. The process involves analyzing the code, interpreting the output, utilizing visualizations to support analysis, and providing recommendations based on the insights gained. The dataset used in the analysis contains mushroom characteristics. The code eliminates redundant variables and examines the odor variable. It then divides the data into training and testing sets, creates a decision tree model using rpart, visualizes the tree with rpart.plot, prunes the tree to achieve optimal complexity, tests the model using the testing data, and calculates the accuracy of the model using the confusion Matrix function from caret.
